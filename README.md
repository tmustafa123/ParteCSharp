## ✨ ParteCSharp

A `Console App` that takes inputs from the user and outputs character names
A function that takes two integers as parameters and that, starting from the minor up to
greater than the two, examines all the integers included in the range by writing the value in for each
console and:
- If it is an even number, it writes "Pippo" to the console
- If it is a multiple of 3, it writes "Pluto" in the console
- If it is a power of 2, it writes “Donald Duck” in the console and ends immediately.
NB: for the third point, assume that there is an IsPowerOfTwo (n) function which returns true if n
is a power of 2, false otherwise
